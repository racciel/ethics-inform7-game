"Researcher Dilemma" by "Andreas Leja"

[ROOMS START HERE]
The Setup is a room. "Welcome to the world of academic research. Before we begin, please tell us your name and your field of research."
The Welcome is a room. "A plain, white room with two folders on the table: one marked Dr. Stern, the other Dr. Vale. Your PhD begins now. You can examine their files or pick one of those supervisors."
Data Crisis is a room. "You have insufficient data for your paper. Your supervisor is pressuring you to submit it anyway. Do you fake the data or stay honest?"
Authorship is a room. "Your paper is published, but Dr. Stern has added his name as lead author without contributing anything. Do you confront him or stay silent?"
Plagiarism is a room. "You are struggling to meet a deadline. A colleague offers you their old paper to 'borrow' from. Do you copy or write own?"
Grant Misuse is a room. "You receive a research grant, but your lab is short on supplies. Do you use the grant for personal expenses or follow the rules?"

ChatGPT Dilemma is a room. "You are struggling to write a section of your paper. You consider using ChatGPT to generate text, but your university has unclear policies on AI-generated content. Do you use ChatGPT or write it yourself?"
Data Leak is a room. "You accidentally send a dataset containing sensitive participant information to a collaborator. Do you tell someone or try to fix quietly?"
The Participant Harm is a room. "Your experiment is producing interesting results, but a participant reports feeling distressed. Do you stop the experiment, protecting participant or do you continue the experiment?"

Hall of fame is a room. "Congratulations! You have successfully navigated the ethical dilemmas of your academic journey. Your name is now in the Hall of Fame for researchers!"
